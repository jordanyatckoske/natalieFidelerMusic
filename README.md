  Natalie Fideler Music
</h1>

This project is build for a local musican, Natalie Fideler, who is based out of Minneapolis. I have used React (NEXT) on the frontend with a CMS built using Netlify CMS for content editing. Additional styling using Bulma and SCSS is used.

This project is a work in progress. Current version can be found here: https://nataliefideler.netlify.app/
