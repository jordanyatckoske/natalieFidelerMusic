artistName: Natalie Fideler
artistBio: >-
  **Natalie Fideler** is the front-person of her self-titled power trio
  currently based in Minneapolis, MN. She has performed with several bands over
  the years, but the release of her debut album **“Steak & Eggs”** marks the
  beginning of her career as a solo act. Her band consists of herself on guitar,
  keyboards, and lead vocals, **Hailey Jacobsenon** bass, and **Leigh
  Underwood** on drums.


  Some of Natalie’s most recent endeavors include her **sold-out** debut album
  release show at the **Red Raven Espresso Parlor**, being a selected artist for
  the Fargo-Moorhead **Celebration of Women and their Music**, headlining the
  legendary **7th St Entry of First Avenue**, a TV episode as well as an
  in-studio radio feature with **Prairie Public Broadcasting**, airplay on radio
  stations such as **93X**, **The Current**, and **KFAI**, and several feature
  performances presented by MN nonprofit **She Rock She Rock**.


  Her chosen genre is ‘alternative pop’ which is riddled with honesty and
  influenced by everything from Bikini Kill to Beethoven. Through the use of
  colorful harmonies, intricate lyrics, stylistic double-dipping, and cheeky
  honesty, Fideler seeks to inspire deeper thought and personal reflection via
  catchy tunes that will leave you dancing and ripping your heart out at the
  same time.
